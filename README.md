* **Rating Distribution:** Visualization of the spread of ratings given by customers for various service aspects.
* **Key Review Topics:** Identification of themes or keywords that most frequently appear in customer reviews, such as seat comfort, cabin service, catering, in-flight entertainment, etc.
* **Service Category Analysis:** Breakdown of ratings or sentiment by specific service categories (e.g., ground service, in-flight service, value for money).
* **Identification of Strengths and Areas for Improvement:** Highlighting service aspects that customers appreciate most and areas that receive the most complaints.
